## Notes

I wrote this for use with the [Nova](https://nova.app) text editor and it is integrated in the [perl tree sitter](https://github.com/mrsdizzie/nova-perl-treesitter) extension. For other editors like neovim you can see their [documentation](https://neovim.io/doc/user/treesitter.html) and adjust the included queries accordingly.
